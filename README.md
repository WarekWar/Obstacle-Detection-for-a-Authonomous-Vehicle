# Obstacle-Detection-for-a-Authonomous-Vehicle
The aim of this work is to simulate the system of obstacle detection in autonomous vehicle. 

The priciples were following:
- A vehicle moves with constant speed
- In front of a car an obstacle appears
- The system detects it
- The distance between the vehicle and the obbstacle is calculated
- The distance is compared to the braking distance
- Depending on a result, user receives information
